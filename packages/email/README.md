# Builder Email

Components for building HTML emails in Builder

## Getting Started

To get started building emails in Builder create an account via [builder.io/signup](https://builder.io/signup). Then go to [builder.io/models](https://builder.io/models) and create a new `email` model.

Then you can drag and drop to Build emails and grab the code to put in your ESP, or use our [HTML API](https://www.builder.io/c/docs/html-api) to grab email contents with automation, where you can leverage features like [targeting and scheduling](https://www.builder.io/c/docs/guides/targeting-and-scheduling) and [connecting dynamic data](https://www.builder.io/c/docs/guides/connecting-api-data) to your visually created/edited emails
